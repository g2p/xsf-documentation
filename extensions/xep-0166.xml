<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>There exists no widely-adopted standard for initiating and managing peer-to-peer (p2p) interactions (such as voice, video, or file sharing exchanges) from within Jabber/XMPP clients. Although several large service providers and Jabber/XMPP clients have written and implemented their own proprietary XMPP extensions for p2p signalling (usually only for voice), those technologies are not open and do not always take into account requirements to interoperate with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks based on the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as specified in &rfc3261; and its various extensions.</p>
  <p>By contrast, the only existing open protocol has been &xep0111;, which made it possible to initiate and manage p2p sessions, but which did not provide enough of the key signalling semantics to be easily implemented in Jabber/XMPP clients. <note>It is true that TINS made it relatively easy to implement an XMPP-to-SIP gateway; however, in line with the long-time Jabber philosophy of "simple clients, complex servers", it would be better to force complexity onto the server-side gateway and to keep the client as simple as possible.</note></p> 
  <p>The result has been an unfortunate fragmentation within the XMPP community regarding signalling protocols. There are, essentially, two approaches to solving the problem:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Recommend that all client developers implement a dual-stack (XMPP + SIP) solution.</li>
    <li>Define a full-featured protocol for XMPP signalling.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Implementation experience indicates that a dual-stack approach may not be feasible on all the computing platforms for which Jabber clients have been written, or even desirable on platforms where it is feasible. Therefore, it seems reasonable to define an XMPP signalling protocol that can provide the necessary signalling semantics while also making it relatively straightforward to interoperate with existing Internet standards.</p>
  <p>As a result of feedback received on <cite>XEP-0111</cite>, the original authors of this document (Joe Hildebrand and Peter Saint-Andre) began to define such a signalling protocol, code-named Jingle. Upon communication with members of the Google Talk team, <note>Google Talk is a messaging and voice chat service and client provided by Google; see &lt;<link url='http://www.google.com/talk/'>http://www.google.com/talk/</link>&gt;.</note> it was discovered that the emerging Jingle approach was conceptually (and even syntactically) quite similar to the signalling protocol used in the Google Talk application. Therefore, in the interest of interoperability and adoption, we decided to harmonize the two approaches. The signalling protocol specified herein is, therefore, substantially equivalent to the existing Google Talk protocol, with several adjustments based on feedback received from implementors as well as for publication within the XMPP Standards Foundation's standards process.</p>
  <p>The purpose of Jingle is not to supplant or replace SIP. Because dual-stack XMPP+SIP clients are difficult to build, given that they essentially have two centers of program control, <note>For example, one large ISP recently decided to switch to a pure XMPP approach after having implemented and deployed a dual-stack client for several years.</note> we have designed Jingle as a pure XMPP signalling protocol. However, Jingle is intended to interwork with SIP so that the millions of deployed XMPP clients can be added onto the existing open VoIP networks, rather than limiting XMPP users to a separate and distinct VoIP network.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The protocol defined herein is designed to meet the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make it possible to manage a wide variety of peer-to-peer sessions (not limited to voice and video) within XMPP. <note>Possible other content description formats include file sharing, application casting, application sharing, whiteboarding, torrent broadcasting, shared real-time editing, and distributed musical performance, to name but a few.</note>.</li>
    <li>Clearly separate the signalling channel (XMPP) from the data channel (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol as specified in &rfc3550;).</li>
    <li>Clearly separate the content description formats (e.g., for voice chat) from the content transport methods (e.g., User Datagram Protocol as specified in &rfc0768;).</li>
    <li>Make it possible to add, modify, and remove content types from an existing session.</li>
    <li>Make it relatively easy to implement support for the protocol in standard Jabber/XMPP clients.</li>
    <li>Where communication with non-XMPP entities is needed, push as much complexity as possible onto server-side gateways between the XMPP network and the non-XMPP network.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This document defines the signalling protocol only. Additional documents specify the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Various content description formats (audio, video, etc.) and, where possible, mapping those types to the Session Description Protocol (SDP; see &rfc4566;); examples include &xep0167; and &xep0180;.</p></li>
    <li><p>Various content transport methods; examples include &xep0176; and &xep0177;.</p></li>
    <li><p>Procedures for mapping the Jingle signalling protocol to existing signalling standards such as the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (SIP; see &rfc3261;) and the ITU's H.323 protocol (see &h323;); these documents are forthcoming.</p></li>

<section1 topic='Concepts and Approach' anchor='concepts'>
  <p>Jingle consists of three parts, each with its own syntax, semantics, and state machine:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Overall session management</li>
    <li>Content description formats (the "what")</li>
    <li>Content transport methods (the "how")</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This document defines the semantics and syntax for overall session management. It also provides pluggable "slots" for content description formats and content transport methods, which are specified in separate documents; however, for the sake of completeness, this document also includes examples for all of the actions related to description formats and transport methods.</p>
  <p>At the most basic level, the process for negotiating a Jingle session is as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>One user (the "initator") sends to another user (the "receiver") a session request with one content type, which includes at least one content type.</li>
    <li>If the receiver wants to proceed, it provisionally accepts the request by sending an IQ result.</li>
    <li>Both the initiator and receive start exchanging possible transport candidates as quickly as possible (these are sent in quick succession before further negotiation in order to minimize the time required before media data can flow).</li>
    <li>These candidates are checked for connectivity.</li>
    <li>As soon as the receiver finds a candidate over which media can flow, the receiver sends to the initiator a "session-accept" action.</li>
    <li>The parties start sending media over the negotiated candidate.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If the parties later discover a better candidate, they perform a "content-modify" negotiation and then switch to the better candidate. Naturally they can also modify various other parameters related to the session (e.g., adding video to a voice chat).</p>
  <section2 topic='Overall Session Management' anchor='concepts-session'>
    <p>The state machine for overall session management (i.e., the state per Session ID) is as follows:</p>
    <code>

<section1 topic='Session Flow' anchor='session'>
  <section2 topic='Resource Determination' anchor='session-resource'>
    <p>In order to initiate a Jingle session, the initiator must determine which of the receiver's XMPP resources is best for the desired content description format. If a contact has only one XMPP resource, this task MUST be completed using &xep0030; or the presence-based profile of service discovery specified in &xep0115;.</p>
    <p>Naturally, instead of sending service discovery requests to every contact in a user's roster, it is more efficient to use <cite>Entity Capabilities</cite>, whereby support for Jingle and various Jingle content description formats and content transport methods is determined for a client version in general (rather than on a per-JID basis) and then cached. Refer to <cite>XEP-0115</cite> for details.</p>
    <p>If a contact has more than one XMPP resource, it may be that only one of the resources supports Jingle and the desired content description format, in which case the user MUST initiate the Jingle signalling with that resource.</p>
    <p>If a contact has more than one XMPP resource that supports Jingle and the desired content description format, it is RECOMMENDED for a client to use &xep0168; in order to determine which is the best resource with which to initiate the desired Jingle session.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Initiation' anchor='protocol-initiate'>
    <p>Once the initiator has discovered which of the receiver's XMPP resources is ideal for the desired content description format, it sends a session initiation request to the receiver. This request is an IQ-set containing a &JINGLE; element qualified by the 'http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html#ns' namespace. The &JINGLE; element MUST possess the 'action', 'initiator', and 'sid' attributes (the latter two uniquely identify the session). For initiation, the 'action' attribute MUST have a value of "session-initiate" and the &JINGLE; element MUST contain one or more &CONTENT; elements, each of which defines a content type to be transferred during the session; each &CONTENT; element in turn contains one &DESCRIPTION; child element that specifies a desired content description format and one &TRANSPORT; child element that specifies a potential content transport method. If either party wishes to propose the use of multiple transport methods for the same content description, it must send multiple &CONTENT; elements.</p>
    <p>The following example shows a Jingle session initiation request for a session that contains both audio and video content:</p>

    <p>Note: The syntax and semantics of the &DESCRIPTION; and &TRANSPORT; elements are out of scope for this specification, but are defined in related specifications.</p>
    <p>The attributes of the &JINGLE; element are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'action' attribute is REQUIRED; it specifies a Jingle action as listed in this document (e.g., "session-initiate").</li>
      <li>The 'initiator' attribute is the full JID of the entity that has initiated the session flow (which may be different from the 'from' address on the IQ-set).</li>
      <li>The OPTIONAL 'reasoncode' attribute specifies a machine-readable purpose for the action being sent (e.g., "connectivity-error" for a session-terminate action).</li>
      <li>The OPTIONAL 'reasontext' attribute specifies a human-readable purpose for the action being sent (e.g., "Sorry, gotta go!" for a session-terminate action).</li>
      <li>The 'responder' attribute (see examples below) is the full JID of the entity that has replied to the initiation (which may be different from the 'to' address on the IQ-set).</li>
      <li>The 'sid' attribute is a random session identifier generated by the initiator; this SHOULD match the XML Nmtoken production <note>See &lt;<link url='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814#NT-Nmtoken'>http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814#NT-Nmtoken</link>&gt;</note> so that XML character escaping is not needed for characters such as &amp;. (Note: the 'sid' attribute effectively maps to the SIP "Call-ID" parameter.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The attributes of the &CONTENT; element are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'creator' attribute is REQUIRED; it specifies which party originally generated the content description (used to prevent race conditions regarding modifications).</li>
      <li>The 'name' attribute is REQUIRED; it specifies a unique name or identifier for the content type (this identifier is opaque and does not have semantic meaning).</li>
      <li>The 'profile' attribute is RECOMMENDED; for some content types, it specifies the profile in use (e.g., "RTP/AVP" in the context of the Real-time Transport Protocol).</li>
      <li>The 'senders' attribute is RECOMMENDED; it specifies which entities in the session will be generating content; the allowable values are "initiator", "recipient", or "both" (where "both" is the default).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: In order to expedite session establishment, the initiator MAY send transport candidates (e.g., for negotiation of the ICE transport) immediately after sending the "session-initiate" message and before receiving acknowledgement from the receiver (i.e., the initiator MUST consider the session to be live even before receiving acknowledgement). Given in-order delivery, the receiver should receive such "transport-info" messages after receiving the "session-initiate" message (if not, it is appropriate for the receiver to return &lt;unknown-session/&gt; errors since it according to its state machine the session does not exist).</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Receiver Response' anchor='protocol-response'>
    <p>Unless an error occurs, the receiver MUST acknowledge receipt of the initiation request:</p>

    <p>If the receiver acknowledges receipt of the initation request, both parties must consider the session to be in the PENDING state.</p>
    <p>There are several reasons why the receiver might return an error instead of acknowledging receipt of the initiation request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The initiator is unknown to the receiver (e.g., via presence subscription) and the receiver does not communicate with unknown entities.</li>
      <li>The receiver wishes to redirect to another address.</li>

  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Negotiation' anchor='session-negotiation'>
    <p>In general, negotiation will be necessary before the parties can agree on an acceptable set of content types, content description formats, and content transport methods. The potential combinations of parameters to be negotiated are many, and not all are shown herein (some are shown in the relevant specifications for various content description formats and content transport methods).</p>
    <p>One session-level negotiation is to <em>remove</em> a content types. For example, let us imagine that Juliet is having a bad hair day. She certainly does not want to include video in her Jingle session with Romeo, so she sends a "content-remove" request to Romeo:</p>
    <example caption="Content Type Removal"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' to='romeo@montague.net/orchard' id='reduce1' type='set'>
  <jingle xmlns='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html#ns'

    <content creator='initiator' name='this-is-the-video-content'/>

    <p>The entity receiving the session reduction request then acknowledges the request:</p>
    <example caption="Acknowledgement"><![CDATA[
<iq from='romeo@montague.net/orchard' to='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' id='reduce1' type='result'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If the reduction results in no more content types for the session, the entity that receives the session-reduce SHOULD send a session-terminate action to the other party (since a session with no content types is void).</p>
    <p>Another session-level negotiation is to <em>add</em> a content type; however, this MUST NOT be done while the session is in the PENDING state and is allowed only while the session is in the ACTIVE state.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Acceptance' anchor='session-acceptance'>
    <p>If (after negotiation of content transport methods and content description formats) the receiver determines that it will be able to establish a connection, it sends a definitive acceptance to the initiator:</p>
    <example caption="Receiver Definitively Accepts the Call"><![CDATA[
<iq type='set' from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' to='romeo@montague.net/orchard' id='accept1'>

      </transport>
    </content>
  </jingle>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The &JINGLE; element in the accept stanza MUST contain one or more &lt;content/&gt; elements, each of which MUST contain only one &lt;description/&gt; element and one or more &lt;transport/&gt; elements. The &JINGLE; element SHOULD possess a 'responder' attribute that explicitly specifies the full JID of the responding entity, and the initiator SHOULD send all future commmunications about this Jingle session to the JID provided in the 'responder' attribute.</p>
    <p>The initiator then acknowledges the receiver's definitive acceptance:</p>
    <example caption="Initiator Acknowledges Definitive Acceptance"><![CDATA[
<iq type='result' to='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' from='romeo@montague.net/orchard' id='accept1'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Now the initiator and receiver can begin sending content over the negotiated connection.</p>
    <p>If one of the parties cannot find a suitable content transport method, it SHOULD terminate the session as described below.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Modifying an Active Session' anchor='session-modify'>
    <p>In order to modify an active session, either party may send a "content-remove", "content-add", "content-modify", "description-modify", or "transport-modify" action to the other party. The receiving party then sends an appropriate "-accept" or "-decline" action, and may first send an appropriate "-info" action.</p>
    <p>If both parties send modify messages at the same time, the modify message from the session initiator MUST trump the modify message from the recipient and the initiator SHOULD return an &unexpected; error to the other party.</p>
    <p>One example of modifying an active session is to <em>add</em> a content type. For example, let us imagine that Juliet gets her hair in order and now wants to add video. She now sends a "content-add" request to Romeo:</p>

  <section2 topic='Termination' anchor='session-terminate'>
    <p>In order to gracefully end the session (which MAY be done at any point after acknowledging receipt of the initiation request, including immediately thereafter in order to decline the request), either the receiver or the initiator MUST a send a "terminate" action to the other party:</p>
    <example caption="Receiver Terminates the Session"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony'
    id='term1'
    to='romeo@montague.net/orchard'
    type='set'>
  <jingle xmlns='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html#ns'
          action='session-terminate'
          initiator='romeo@montague.net/orchard'
          reason='Sorry, gotta go!'
          sid='a73sjjvkla37jfea'/>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The other party (in this case the initiator) MUST then acknowledge termination of the session:</p>
    <example caption="Initiator Acknowledges Termination"><![CDATA[
<iq type='result' to='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' from='romeo@montague.net/orchard' id='term1'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Note: As soon as an entity sends a "session-terminate" action, it MUST consider the session to be ended (even before receiving acknowledgement from the other party). If the terminating entity receives additional IQ-sets from the other party after sending the "session-terminate" action, it MUST reply with an &lt;unknown-session/&gt; error.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, not all sessions end gracefully. The following events MUST be considered session-ending events, and any further Jingle communication for the negotiated content description format and content transport method MUST be completed through negotiation of a new session:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receipt of a 'session-redirect' or 'session-terminate' action from the other party.</li>
      <li>Receipt of &UNAVAILABLE; from the other party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In particular, one party MUST consider the session to be in the ENDED state if it receives presence of type "unavailable" from the other party:</p>
    <example caption="Receiver Goes Offline"><![CDATA[
<presence from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' to='romeo@montague.net/orchard' type='unavailable'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Naturally, in this case there is nothing for the initiator to acknowledge.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Informational Messages' anchor='session-info'>
    <p>At any point after initiation of a Jingle session, either entity MAY send an informational message to the other party, for example to change a content transport method or content description format parameter, inform the other party that a session initiation request is queued, that a device is ringing, or that a scheduled event has occurred or will occur. An information message MUST be an IQ-set containing a &JINGLE; element whose 'action' attribute is set to a value of "session-info", "description-info", or "transport-info"; the &JINGLE; element MUST further contain a payload child element (speciific to the session, content description format, or content transport method) that specifies the information being communicated. If either party receives an empty "session-info" message for an active session, it MUST send an empty IQ result; this way, an empty "session-info" message may be used as a "ping" to determine session vitality. (A future version of this specification may define payloads related to the "session-info" action.)</p>
