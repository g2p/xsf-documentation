  <abstract>This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for initiating and managing peer-to-peer media sessions between two XMPP entities in a way that is interoperable with existing Internet standards. The protocol provides a pluggable model that enables the core session management semantics to be used for a wide variety of application types (e.g., voice chat, video chat, file sharing) and with a wide variety of transport methods (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICE, application-specific transports).</abstract>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>The purpose of Jingle is to enable one-to-one, peer-to-peer media sessions between XMPP entities, where the negotiation occurs over the XMPP "channel" and the media is exchanged outside the XMPP channel using technologies such as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP; &rfc3550;), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP; &rfc0768;), and &ice;.</p>
  <p>One target application for Jingle is simple voice chat (see &xep0167;). We stress the word "simple". The purpose of Jingle is not to build a full-fledged telephony application that supports call waiting, call forwarding, call transfer, hold music, IVR systems, find-me-follow-me functionality, conference calls, and the like. These features are of interest to some user populations, but adding support for them to the core Jingle layer would introduce unnecessary complexity into a technology that is designed for basic multimedia interaction.</p>
  <p>The purpose of Jingle is not to supplant or replace technologies based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP; &rfc3261;). Because dual-stack XMPP+SIP clients are difficult to build, Jingle was designed as a pure XMPP signalling protocol. However, Jingle is at the same time designed to interwork with SIP so that the millions of deployed XMPP clients can be added onto existing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks, rather than limiting XMPP users to a separate and distinct network.</p>
  <p>Jingle is designed in a modular way so that developers can easily add support for multimedia session types other than voice chat, such as video chat (see &xep0180;), application sharing, file sharing, collaborative editing, whiteboarding, and torrent broadcasting. The transport methods are also modular, so that Jingle implementations can use any appropriate media transport (including proprietary methods not standardized through the XMPP Standards Foundation).</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='How It Works' anchor='howitworks'>
  <p>This section provides a friendly introduction to Jingle.</p>
  <p>In essence, Jingle enables two XMPP entities (e.g., romeo@montague.lit and juliet@capulet.lit) to set up, manage, and tear down a multimedia session. The negotiation takes place over XMPP, and the media transfer takes place outside of XMPP. The simplest session flow is as follows:</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
Romeo                         Juliet
  |                             |
  |   session-initiate          |
  |---------------------------->|
  |   ack                       |
  |<----------------------------|
  |   session-accept            |
  |<----------------------------|
  |   ack                       |
  |---------------------------->|
  |   MEDIA SESSION             |
  |<===========================>|
  |   session-terminate         |
  |<----------------------------|
  |   ack                       |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  ]]></code>
  <p>Naturally, more complex scenarios are probable; such scenarios are described in other specifications, such as <cite>XEP-0167</cite> for voice chat.</p>
  <p>The simplest flow might happen as follows. The example is that of a file transfer offer, where the transport method is &xep0065;.</p>

  <p>The parties would then attempt to negotiate use of the SOCKS5 Bytestreams transport method, as described in <cite>XEP-0065</cite>.</p>
  <p>Once the file transfer succeeds, one of the parties terminates the session.</p>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The protocol defined herein is designed to meet the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make it possible to manage a wide variety of peer-to-peer sessions (including but not limited to voice and video) within XMPP.</li>
    <li>When a peer-to-peer connection cannot be negotiated, make it possible to fall back to relayed communications.</li>
    <li>Clearly separate the signalling channel (XMPP) from the data channel.</li>
    <li>Clearly separate the application formats (e.g., video) from the transport methods (e.g., RTP).</li>
    <li>Make it possible to add, modify, and remove both application types and transport methods in relation to an existing session.</li>
    <li>Make it relatively easy to implement support for the protocol in standard Jabber/XMPP clients.</li>
    <li>Where communication with non-XMPP entities is needed, push as much complexity as possible onto server-side gateways between the XMPP network and the non-XMPP network.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This document defines the signalling protocol only. Additional documents specify the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Various application formats (audio, video, etc.) and, where possible, mapping of those types to the Session Description Protocol (SDP; see &rfc4566;); examples include <cite>Jingle Audio via RTP</cite> and <cite>Jingle Video via RTP</cite>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Various transport methods; examples include &xep0176; and <cite>Raw UDP Transport</cite>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Procedures for mapping the Jingle signalling protocol to existing signalling standards such as the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the ITU's H.323 protocol (see &h323;); these documents are forthcoming.</p></li>

<section1 topic='Concepts and Approach' anchor='concepts'>
  <p>Jingle consists of three parts, each with its own syntax and semantics:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Overall session management</li>
    <li>Application types (the "what")</li>
    <li>Transport methods (the "how")</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This document defines the semantics and syntax for overall session management. It also provides pluggable "slots" for application formats and transport methods, which are specified in separate documents.</p>
  <p>At the most basic level, the process for initial negotiation of a Jingle session is as follows (i.e., the actions that can be generated during the PENDING state):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>One user (the "initator") sends to another user (the "responder") a session request with at least one content type.</li>
    <li>If the responder wants to proceed, it acknowledges the session initiation request by sending an IQ result.</li>
    <li>The parties attempt to set up data transmission over the designated transport method as defined in the relevant specification (e.g., this may involve sending multiple transport-info actions).</li>
    <li>Optionally, the responder may remove content types via the content-remove action or change the direction of the media flow via the content-modify action.</li>
    <li>Optionally, either party may send session-info actions (to inform the other party that it is attempting transport negotiation, that its device is ringing, etc.).</li>
    <li>As soon as the responder determines that data can flow over the designated transport, it sends to the initiator a session-accept action.</li>
    <li>The parties start sending data over the transport.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After the initial session negotiation has been completed and the session is in the ACTIVE state, the parties can adjust the session definition. This may involve sending the content-modify and content-remove actions (which are allowed while in the PENDING state), but it may also involve sending the content-add and content-replace actions, which are acknowledged via the content-accept action. In addition, certain transport methods allow continued sending of transport-info actions while in the ACTIVE state. And naturally the parties may send session-info actions at any time.</p>
  <section2 topic='Overall Session Management' anchor='concepts-session'>
    <p>The state machine for overall session management (i.e., the state per Session ID) is as follows:</p>

  <p>This section defines the high-level flow of a Jingle session. More detailed descriptions are provided in the specifications for Jingle application formats and transport methods.</p>
  <section2 topic='Resource Determination' anchor='session-resource'>
    <p>In order to initiate a Jingle session, the initiator must determine which of the responder's XMPP resources is best for the desired application format. Methods for doing so are out of scope for this specification. However, see the <link url='#support'>Determining Support</link> section of this document (and associated specifications) for relevant information.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Initiation' anchor='protocol-initiate'>
    <p>Once the initiator has discovered which of the responder's XMPP resources is ideal for the desired application format, it sends a session initiation request to the responder. This request is an IQ-set containing a &JINGLE; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:tmp:jingle' namespace &NSNOTE;, where the value of the 'action' attribute is "session-initiate" and where the &JINGLE; element contains one or more &CONTENT; elements. Each &CONTENT; element defines a content type to be transferred during the session, and each &CONTENT; element in turn contains one &DESCRIPTION; child element that specifies a desired application format and one &TRANSPORT; child element that specifies a potential transport method. If either party wishes to propose the use of multiple transport methods for the same application format, it must send multiple &CONTENT; elements.</p>

    <p>Note: In order to expedite session establishment, the initiator MAY send transport candidates (e.g., for negotiation of the ICE transport) immediately after sending the session-initiate action and before receiving acknowledgement from the responder (i.e., the initiator MUST consider the session to be PENDING even before receiving acknowledgement). Given in-order delivery, the responder should receive such transport-info actions after receiving the session-initiate action (if not, it is appropriate for the responder to return &lt;unknown-session/&gt; errors since according to its state machine the session does not exist).</p>

      <p>However, after acknowledging the session initiation request, the responder may subsequently determine that it cannot proceed with negotiation of the session (e.g., because it does not support any of the offered application formats or transport methods, because a human user is busy or unable to accept the session, because a human user wishes to formally decline the session, etc.). In these cases, the responder SHOULD immediately acknowledge the session initiation request but then terminate the session with an appropriate reason as described in the <link url='#session-terminate'>Termination</link> section of this document.</p>
      <p>If the responder acknowledges receipt of the initation request, both parties must consider the session to be in the PENDING state.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Errors' anchor='protocol-response-errors'>
      <p>There are several reasons why the responder might immediately return an error instead of acknowledging receipt of the initiation request:</p>

      <p>If the initiator is unknown to the responder (e.g., via presence subscription as defined in &rfc3921; or stanza session negotiation as defined in &xep0155;) and the responder has a policy of not communicating via Jingle with unknown entities, it SHOULD return a &unavailable; error.</p>

  <section2 topic='Negotiation' anchor='session-negotiation'>
    <p>In general, negotiation will be necessary before the parties can agree on an acceptable set of application formats and transport methods. There are many potential parameter combinations, as defined in the relevant specifications for various application formats and transport methods.</p>
    <p>The allowable negotiations (including content-level and transport-level negotiations) are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding a content type via the content-add action (not allowed in the PENDING state).</li>
      <li>Modifying the communication direction for a content type via the content-modify action.</li>
      <li>Removing a content type via the content-remove action.</li>
      <li>Changing the definition of a content type via the content-replace action (not allowed in the PENDING state).</li>
      <li>Exchanging transport methods via the transport-info action.</li>
    </ul>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Acceptance' anchor='session-acceptance'>
    <p>If (after negotiation of transport methods and application formats as well as checking of transport candidates) the responder determines that it will be able to establish a connection, it sends a definitive acceptance to the initiator.</p>
    <p>Note: In the session-accept stanza, the &JINGLE; element MUST contain one or more &lt;content/&gt; elements, each of which MUST contain one &lt;description/&gt; element and one &lt;transport/&gt; element. The &JINGLE; element SHOULD possess a 'responder' attribute that explicitly specifies the full JID of the responding entity; after sending acknowledgement of the session-accept, the initiator SHOULD send all future commmunications about this Jingle session to the JID provided in the 'responder' attribute and note the new JID in the user interface.</p>
    <p>The initiator then acknowledges the responder's definitive acceptance, after which the parties can exchange media over the negotiated connection.</p>
    <p>If one of the parties cannot find a suitable transport method or candidate, it SHOULD terminate the session as described below.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Modifying an Active Session' anchor='session-modify'>
    <p>Once a session is in the ACTIVE state, it may be modified via a content-add, content-modify, content-remove, or transport-info action. Examples of such modifications are shown in the specifications for various application formats and transport methods.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Termination' anchor='session-terminate'>
    <p>In order to gracefully end the session (which MAY be done at any point after acknowledging receipt of the initiation request, including immediately thereafter in order to decline the request), either the responder or the initiator MUST send a session-terminate action to the other party.</p>
    <p>The party that terminates the session SHOULD include a &lt;reason/&gt; element that specifies why the session is being terminated. Examples follow.</p>
    <p>One reason for terminating the session is that the terminating party is busy; in this case, the recommended condition is "busy".</p>
    <example caption="Terminating the session (busy)"><![CDATA[

    <reason>
      <condition><busy/></condition>
    </reason>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Another reason for terminating the session is that the terminating party wishes to formally decline the session; in this case, the recommended condition is "decline".</p>

    <reason>
      <condition><decline/></condition>
    </reason>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Another reason for terminating the session is that the terminating party already has an existing session with the other party and wishes to use that session rather than initiate a new session; in this case, the recommended condition is "alternative-session" and the terminating party SHOULD include the session ID of the atlernative session in the &lt;sid/&gt; element.</p>
    <example caption="Terminating the session (existing session)"><![CDATA[
<iq from='laertes@shakespeare.lit/castle'

    <p>Another reason for terminating the session is that the terminating party does not support any of the offered transport methods; in this case, the recommended condition is "unsupported-transports".</p>
    <example caption="Terminating the session (no offered transport method supported)"><![CDATA[
<iq from='laertes@shakespeare.lit/castle'

      <condition><unsupported-transports/></condition>
    </reason>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Upon receiving an action of "session-terminate", the other party MUST then acknowledge termination of the session:</p>
    <example caption="Acknowledging termination"><![CDATA[
<iq from='kingclaudius@shakespeare.lit/castle'
    id='term1'
    to='laertes@shakespeare.lit/castle'
    type='result'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Note: As soon as an entity sends a session-terminate action, it MUST consider the session to be in the ENDED state (even before receiving acknowledgement from the other party). If the terminating entity receives additional Jingle-related IQ-sets from the other party after sending the session-terminate action, it MUST reply with an &lt;unknown-session/&gt; error.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, not all sessions end gracefully. In applications of Jingle that also involve the exchange of presence information, receipt of &UNAVAILABLE; from the other party MAY be considered a session-ending event. However, in this case there is nothing for the party to acknowledge.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Informational Messages' anchor='session-info'>
    <p>At any point after initiation of a Jingle session, either entity MAY send an informational message to the other party, for example to inform the other party that a device is ringing.</p>
    <example caption="Responder sends ringing message"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony'

    <ringing xmlns='urn:xmpp:tmp:jingle:apps:audio-rtp:info'/>
  </jingle>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>An informational message MUST be an IQ-set containing a &JINGLE; element whose 'action' attribute is set to a value of "session-info" or "transport-info"; the &JINGLE; element MUST further contain a payload child element (specific to the session or to a transport method) that specifies the information being communicated. If the party that receives an informational message does not understand the payload, it MUST return a &feature; error with a Jingle-specific error condition of &lt;unsupported-info/&gt;.</p>
    <example caption="Receiver returns unsupported-info error"><![CDATA[

</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If either party receives an empty session-info action for an active session, it MUST send an empty IQ result; this way, an empty session-info action may be used as a "ping" to determine session vitality.</p>

    <p>Jingle sessions may be resource-intensive. Therefore, it is possible to launch a denial-of-service attack against an entity by burdening it with too many Jingle sessions.

  <section2 topic='Communication Through Gateways' anchor='security-gateways'>
    <p>Jingle communications may be enabled through gateways to non-XMPP networks, whose security characteristics may be quite different from those of XMPP networks.

  <section2 topic='Information Exposure' anchor='security-info'>
    <p>Mere negotiation of a Jingle session may expose sensitive information about the parties (e.g., IP addresses). Care must be taken in communicating such information, and end-to-end encryption should be used if the parties do not trust the intermediate servers or gateways.</p>

<section1 topic='History' anchor='history'>
  <p>Until Jingle was developed, there existed no widely-adopted standard for initiating and managing peer-to-peer interactions between XMPP entities. Although several large service providers and Jabber client teams had written and implemented their own proprietary XMPP extensions for peer-to-peer signalling (usually only for voice), those technologies were not open and did not always take into account requirements to interoperate with SIP-based technologies. The only existing open protocol was &xep0111;, which made it possible to initiate and manage peer-to-peer sessions, but which did not provide enough of the key signalling semantics to be easily implemented in Jabber/XMPP clients. <note>It is true that TINS made it relatively easy to implement an XMPP-to-SIP gateway; however, in line with the long-time Jabber philosophy of "simple clients, complex servers", it would be better to force complexity onto the server-side gateway and to keep the client as simple as possible.</note></p>
  <p>The result was an unfortunate fragmentation within the XMPP community regarding signalling protocols. Essentially, there were two possible approaches to solving the problem:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Recommend that all client developers implement a dual-stack (XMPP + SIP) solution.</li>
    <li>Define a full-featured protocol for XMPP signalling.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Implementation experience indicates that a dual-stack approach may not be feasible on all the computing platforms for which Jabber clients have been written, or even desirable on platforms where it is feasible. <note>For example, one large ISP decided to switch to a pure XMPP approach after having implemented and deployed a dual-stack client for several years.</note> Therefore, it seemed reasonable to define an XMPP signalling protocol that could provide the necessary session management semantics while also making it relatively straightforward to interoperate with existing Internet standards.</p>
  <p>As a result of feedback received on <cite>XEP-0111</cite>, the original authors of this document (Joe Hildebrand and Peter Saint-Andre) began to define such a signalling protocol, code-named Jingle. Upon communication with members of the Google Talk team, <note>Google Talk is a messaging and voice chat service and client provided by Google; see &lt;<link url='http://www.google.com/talk/'>http://www.google.com/talk/</link>&gt;.</note> it was discovered that the emerging Jingle approach was conceptually (and even syntactically) quite similar to the signalling protocol used in the Google Talk application. Therefore, in the interest of interoperability and adoption, we decided to harmonize the two approaches. The signalling protocol specified herein is, therefore, substantially equivalent to the original Google Talk protocol, with several adjustments based on feedback received from implementors as well as for publication by the XMPP Standards Foundation.</p>
