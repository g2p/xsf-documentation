<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>In certain kinds of XMPP deployments, multiple connection managers associated with the XMPP server may be used to handle requests from connecting clients. When such an architecture is used in environments that make use of Kerberos V and negotiation of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) over XMPP, the connection manager may need to give the client additional information about its principal so that the client can obtain a proper ticket for authentication.</p>
  <p>This scenario was not addressed in &rfc3920;. However, the problem can now be solved using the concept of domain-based service names as described in &kittenspn;. In particular, because XMPP servers typically use the Kerberos V5 ("GSSAPI") SASL mechanism as described in &rfc4752;, they can communicate domain-based names as Kerberos V service principal names as described in &kittenspnkrb5;.</p>
  <p>Therefore this document defines a method for communication of Kerberos V domain-based service names in the context of SASL negotiation by XMPP entities.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Protocol' anchor='proto'>
  <p>When a connection manager associated with an XMPP server needs to communicate additional information about its service principal name to a connecting client, it can do so by including a child element of the &lt;mechanisms/&gt; element during SASL negotation, as specified in &rfc3920bis;. In the case of the Kerberos V SASL mechanism, the child element is a &lt;hostname/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:tmp:domain-based-name' namespace &NSNOTE;. The &lt;hostname/&gt; element MUST include a 'mechanism' attribute, where the value MUST be "GSSAPI". The XML character data of the &lt;hostname/&gt; element shall specify the fully-qualified name of the connection manager (known as the hostname). The client then generates a domain-based service name from the provided hostname, following the format specified in <cite>draft-ietf-kitten-krb5-gssapi-domain-based-names</cite> (i.e., "protocol/hostname/domainname@REALM"):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>protocol</strong> string MUST be "xmpp"</li>
    <li>The <strong>hostname</strong> string MUST be the XML character data of the &lt;hostname/&gt; element</li>
    <li>The <strong>domainname</strong> string MUST be the canonical name of the service</li>
    <li>The <strong>REALM</strong> string SHOULD be determined according to the network policies in effect (usually the domain name, in an uppercase mapping)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the example of an XMPP service whose canonical name is "example.com". A user may in fact connect to the physical machine "cm7.us.example.com". The hostname would be communicated as follows.</p>
  <example caption="Communicating the hostname"><![CDATA[
<mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
  <mechanism>GSSAPI</mechanism>
  <mechanism>DIGEST-MD5</mechanism>
  <required/>
  <hostname xmlns='urn:xmpp:tmp:domain-based-name'
            mechanism='GSSAPI'>cm7.us.example.com</hostname>
</mechanisms> 
  ]]></example>
  <p>The client would then attempt to obtain a ticket for the domain-based principal "xmpp/cm7.us.example.com/example.com@EXAMPLE.COM".</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>The communication of hostnames during SASL negotiation is not known to introduce new security vulnerabilities. Communication of hostnames SHOULD NOT occur until after the underlying channel has been secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS; &rfc4346;) as described for XMPP in <cite>RFC 3920</cite> and <cite>rfc3920bis</cite>. For additional security considerations, refer to <cite>draft-ietf-kitten-gssapi-domain-based-names</cite> and <cite>draft-ietf-kitten-krb5-gssapi-domain-based-names</cite>.</p>
