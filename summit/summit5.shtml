<h2>XMPP Summit 5</h2>

<p>The <a href='/xsf/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a> will hold its fifth "XMPP Summit" meeting on July 21 and 22, 2008, in Portland, Oregon, USA (the same week as <a href='http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/'>OSCON 2008</a>).</p>

<h3>Participants</h3>

<p>Participation is open to all developers, service operators, and other interested individuals. Please note that this is a hard-code technical get-together with plenty of coding sprints, hackfests, interop testing, brainstorming sessions, geeky lightning talks, etc. This meeting is not intended for marketing presentations and other fluff!</p>
