<h2>XMPP Summit 6</h2>

<p>The sixth <a href='/summit/'>XMPP Summit</a> to be held by the <a href='/xsf/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a> will occur on February 7-9, 2009, in Brussels, Belgium (the same weekend as <a href='http://www.fosdem.org/'>FOSDEM 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Details are still being worked out, but the tentative schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Saturday, February 7</h3>

<p>Public talks and tutorials for larger audiences at FOSDEM (we have a "devroom" from noon to 6 PM); if you are interested in presenting a talk or tutorial, please contact <a href='/xsf/people/stpeter.shtml'>Peter Saint-Andre</a>.</p>

<h3>Sunday, February 8</h3>

<p><a href='/tech/jingle.shtml'>Jingle</a> hackfest at an offsite location (the devroom has been allocated only for Saturday). Those not coding on Jingle are free to visit the second day of the FOSDEM conference, or engage in side discussions / hackfests at the offsite location.</p>

<h3>Monday, February 9</h3>

<p>Intensive discussions among core XMPP developers at an offsite location to solve pressing problems in the XMPP "protocol stack"; the main topics will probably be file transfer and end-to-end encryption as <a href='http://logs.jabber.org/council@conference.jabber.org/2008-12-03.html#14:54:38'>recently prioritized</a> by the <a href='/council/'>XMPP Council</a>.</p>
