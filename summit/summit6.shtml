<h2>XMPP Summit 6</h2>

<p>The sixth <a href='/summit/'>XMPP Summit</a> to be held by the <a href='/xsf/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a> will occur on February 7-9, 2009, in Brussels, Belgium (the same weekend as <a href='http://www.fosdem.org/'>FOSDEM 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Details are still being worked out (join the <a href='http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/summit'>summit@xmpp.org</a> list for discussion), but the tentative schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Friday, February 6</h3>

<p>A <a href='/tech/jingle.shtml'>Jingle</a> hackfest for developers who wish to code and test their implemenations of Jingle, primarily at this point for voice and video.</p>

<h3>Saturday, February 7</h3>

<p>Public talks and tutorials for larger audiences at FOSDEM (we have a "devroom" from noon to 6 PM); if you are interested in presenting a talk or tutorial, please contact <a href='/xsf/people/stpeter.shtml'>Peter Saint-Andre</a>.</p>

<h3>Sunday, February 8</h3>

<p>Developers are free to attend the second day of the FOSDEM conference. We'll need help manning the booth and attending talks to spread the word about XMPP. Also expect many interesting "hallway" discussions and continued hacking in the background.</p>

<h3>Monday, February 9</h3>

<p>The "summit" itself: Intensive discussions among core XMPP developers to solve pressing problems in the XMPP "protocol stack"; the main topics will probably be mobile optimizations, file transfer, and end-to-end encryption as <a href='http://logs.jabber.org/council@conference.jabber.org/2008-12-03.html#14:54:38'>recently prioritized</a> by the <a href='/council/'>XMPP Council</a>.</p>
