      <t>This document defines a method to manage client certificates that can be used with SASL EXTERNAL to allow clients to log in to an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) account without a password.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>An XMPP client typically needs a user name and a password to log in to an XMPP server. Many clients provide a mechanism to store these credentials to automatically log in. While this practice is very user friendly, it is a security risk for some devices. Mobile devices like a mobile phone or a laptop may get stolen, providing the thief with the required password. Mobile phones are particularly insecure: providing the password on the keypad for each log in is too complicated and the risk of losing the phone is high.</t>
      <t>A solution to this problem is to allow a client to log in without knowing the password. XMPP as specified in <xref target='RFC3920'/> and <xref target='rfc3920bis'/> allows the use of any SASL mechanism (see <xref target='SASL'/>) in the authentication of XMPP entities, including the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism. <xref target='XEP-0178'/> defines the usage of X.509 certificates <xref target='X509'/> used in the TLS handshake for SASL EXTERNAL.</t>
      <t>XEP-0178 assumes that the certificates used for SASL EXTERNAL are signed by a trusted CA. This may be a problem for the average user: signing a certificate is both an expensive and a complicated procedure. If the device gets stolen, the user also needs to provide the required information to the CA to revoke the certificate, and the server needs to keep its list of revoked certificates up-to-date. The end-to-end security mechanism described in <xref target='XMPP-E2E'/> relies on self-signed certificates (although CA-issued certificates are allowed). A client capable of secure end-to-end communication already has an X.509 certificate for that purpose. The same client certificate should be used for a client to log in. Since the certificates may not be signed by a trusted CA, the server must be aware of the list of certificates that are used by the users' clients. This document describes how to manage the list of client certificates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Certificate Management' anchor='manage'>
      <t>From the user's point of view the initial client configuration is the same. The user needs to provide the user name and the password for the client to connect to the XMPP server. The main difference is that the client does not store the password for future logins and creates an X.509 certificate for the future. It does not matter if the certificate is self-signed or issued by a trusted third party.</t>
      <section title='Add an X.509 Certificate' anchor='add'>
	<t>After the client has logged in and created the certificate, it uploads the certificate to the server. The &lt;certificate/&gt; data is the X.509 certificate in DER encoding. To be included in an XML stream the data is Base64 encoded. The client also SHOULD provide a human readable name for the certificate to make it possible for the user to manage the different client certificates. The name does not have to be unique; the unique identifier is the certificate's fingerprint.</t>

    <t>The server either returns an empty result or an error. From now on a client can use that certificate to authenticate the user using SASL EXTERNAL. The client does not have to store the password for future logins.</t>
    <t>The client adding the certificate does not need to be the client using it. A user may use a client to upload a certificate for a "bot" (e.g., an automated service or a device such as a set-top box). The bot creates its certificate and private key, and the user uploads the certificate to the server with a different client. After that procedure the bot can log in to the XMPP network and even participate in secure end-to-end communication without ever knowing the user's password.</t>
    <t>An optional element &lt;no-cert-management/&gt; inside the append element indicates that a client logged in with that certificate is not allowed to add or remove certificates from the list. A server MAY allow such a client to query the list of certificates.</t>

      <section title='Remove a Certificate'>
	<t>A client has to create a new certification before its current one expires. After the new certificate is added to the server, it MAY want to remove the old certificate to keep the list of certificates short. Without that, the list will grow indefinitely, making the certificate handling for the user more difficult. Once a certificate is removed it can no longer be used for SASL EXTERNAL. A server MAY automatically remove expired certificates from the list.</t>

	</figure>
      </section>
      <section title='Revoke a Certificate'>
	<t>The user can revoke a certificate for a stolen or compromised device. The mechanism is similar to disabling a certificate. The difference is that if a client is logged in with the compromised certificate using SASL EXTERNAL, the server SHOULD close the stream to that client forcing a logout of the client.</t>

	</figure>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title='SASL EXTERNAL' anchor='sasl'>
      <t>The protocol flow is similar to the one described in XEP-0178. Only step 9 is different: the certificate does not need to be signed by a trusted entity if the certificate was uploaded by the user. The server still MUST reject the certificate if it is expired. In a company environment the server MAY only accept signed certificates; the behavior depends on the company's security policy.</t>
      <t>The client certificate SHOULD include a JID as defined in sections 15.2.1.2. and 15.2.1.3. in rfc3920bis: a JID MUST be represented as an XmppAddr, i.e., as a UTF8String within an otherName entity inside the subjectAltName.</t>
	<figure>
	  <artwork><![CDATA[
    subjectAltName=otherName:id-on-xmppAddr;UTF8:hamlet@example.com
          ]]></artwork>
	</figure>
	<t>If the subjectAltName contains a full JID the server MUST force the client to use the given resource during resource binding. The client is only allowed to use the provided resource name. If a client with the same resource name is currently logged in and that client is not forced to use that resource name, it SHOULD be logged out by the server.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor="sec">
      <section title='Stream Characteristics'>
	<t>This specification allows the user to manipulate an alternative way to log into the server. The certificates are not required to be signed and any certificate can be used. Therefore the server MUST reject any communication described in this document if the link between client and server is not secured with both STARTTLS and SASL to prevent a man-in-the-middle to modify the certificate.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Check subjectAltName'>
	<t>The server MUST check if the JID in the subjectAltName of the certificate matches the bare JID of the user. A user MUST NOT be allowed to upload certificates for a different user.</t>
      </section>
      <section title='Changing the Password'>
	<t><xref target='XEP-0077'/> defines a mechanism to change the password without knowing the current one. If the server supports password change it MUST return not-authorized for clients logged in using SASL EXTERNAL and MAY include a password change form requiring the old password. If the client has logged in with the current password, the server MAY change the password without a form as specified in XEP-0077.</t>
	<t>If a client is allowed to change the password without knowing the current password, the additional security provided by this document is compromised</t>

XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built.  The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions.

	<t>&lt;p>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms.
