<h2>About XMPP</h2>
<p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open XML technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, media session management, shared editing, whiteboarding, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized XML routing.</p>
<p>The core technology was invented by <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/people/jer.shtml'>Jeremie Miller</a> in 1998, refined in the <a href='jabber.shtml'>Jabber</a> open-source community in 1999 and 2000, and formalized by the <a href='http://www.ietf.org/'>IETF</a> in 2002 and 2003, resulting in publication of the <a href='/rfcs/'>XMPP RFCs</a> in 2004.</p>
<p>Although the core technology is stable, the XMPP community continues to define various <a href='/extensions/'>XMPP extensions</a> through an open standards process run by the <a href='/xsf/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a>. There is also an active community of open-source and commercial developers.</p>
