  <title>Link-Local Messaging TXT Records</title>
  &LEGALNOTICE;
  <overview>This is the official registry of Link-Local Messaging TXT Records as maintained by the &REGISTRAR; and authorized by &xep0174;. Note: For historical reasons this registry refers to "Link-Local Messaging" even though the name of the authorizing specification has been changed to "Serverless Messaging".</overview>

<record>
  <name>1st</name>
  <desc>The given or first name of the user.</desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>email</name>
  <desc>
    The email address of the user; may contain a space-separated list 
    of more than one email address.
  </desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>ext</name>
  <desc>
    A space-separated list of extensions; the value of this record MUST 
    be the same as that provided via normal XMPP presence (if applicable) 
    in the 'ext' attribute specified in Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115).
  </desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>hash</name>
  <desc>
    The hashing algorithm used to generated the 'ver' attribute in 
    Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115) and therefore the ver TXT record
    in Link-Local Messaging.
  </desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>jid</name>
  <desc>
    The Jabber ID of the user; may contain a space-separated list of 
    more than one JID.
  </desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>last</name>
  <desc>The family or last name of the user.</desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>msg</name>
  <desc>
    Natural-language text describing the user's state. This is 
    equivalent to the XMPP &lt;status/&gt;; element.
  </desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>nick</name>
  <desc>A friendly or informal name for the user.</desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>node</name>
  <desc>
    A unique identifier for the application; the value of this record MUST 
    be the same as that provided via normal XMPP presence (if applicable) 
    in the 'node' attribute specified in Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115).
  </desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>phsh</name>
  <desc>
    The SHA-1 hash of the user's avatar icon or photo. This SHOULD be 
    requested using mDNS in unicast mode by sending a DNS query to the 
    mDNS multicast address (224.0.0.251 or its IPv6 equivalent FF02::FB).
    The client should keep a local cache of icons keyed by hash. If the 
    phsh value is not in the cache, the client should fetch the unknown 
    icon and then cache it. Implementations should also include logic for 
    expiring avatar icons.
  </desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>port.p2pj</name>
  <desc>
    The port for serverless communications. This MUST be the same as the
    value provided for SRV lookups. Clients MUST use the port discovered 
    via SRV lookups and MUST ignore the value of this TXT record. However, 
    clients SHOULD advertise this TXT record if it is important to ensure
    backwards-compatibility with some existing implementations. (Note: In
    some existing implementations this value was hardcoded to "5298".)
  </desc>
  <status>deprecated</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>status</name>
  <desc>
    The presence availability of the user. Allowable values are "avail", 
    "away", and "dnd", which map to mere XMPP presence (the user is 
    available) and the XMPP &lt;show/&gt; values of "away" and "dnd", 
    respectively; if the status record is not included, the status should 
    be assumed to be "avail".
  </desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>txtvers</name>
  <desc>
    The version of the TXT records supported by the client. For backwards 
    compatibility this is hardcoded at "1". This TXT record should be the
    first one provided, in accordance with the DNS-SD specification.
  </desc>
  <status>deprecated</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>vc</name>
  <desc>
    A flag advertising the user's ability to engage in audio or video 
    conferencing. If the user is able to engage in audio conferencing, 
    the string MUST include the "A" character. If the user is able to 
    engage in video conferencing, the string MUST include the "V" 
    character. If the user is able to engage in conferencing with more 
    than one participant, the string MUST include the "C" character. If 
    the user is not currently engaged in an audio or video conference, 
    the string MUST include the "!" character. The order of characters 
    in the string is immaterial. NOTE: This flag is included only for
    backwards-compatibility; implementations SHOULD use the node, ver, 
    and ext records for more robust capabilities discovery as described 
    in the Discovering Capabilities section of XEP-0174.
  </desc>
  <status>optional</status>
</record>

<record>
  <name>ver</name>
  <desc>
    A hashed string that defines the XMPP service discovery (XEP-0030) 
    identity of the application and the XMPP service discovery features 
    supported by the application; the value of this record MUST be the 
    same as that provided via normal XMPP presence (if applicable) in 
    the 'ver' attribute specified in Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115).
  </desc>
  <status>recommended</status>
