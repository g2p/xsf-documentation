<title>XMPP Technologies: BOSH</title>
<!--#include virtual='/includes/head.txt' -->
<h2>XMPP Technologies: BOSH</h2>
<p>BOSH is "Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP", a technology for bidirectional communication over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). BOSH emulates many of the transport primitives that are familiar from the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). For applications that require both "push" and "pull" communications, BOSH is significantly more bandwidth-efficient and responsive than most other bidirectional HTTP-based transport protocols and the techniques known as AJAX. BOSH achieves this efficiency and low latency by avoiding HTTP polling, yet it does so without resorting to chunked HTTP responses as is done in the technique known as Comet. To date, BOSH has been used mainly as a transport for traffic exchanged between Jabber/XMPP clients and servers (e.g., to facilitate connections from web clients and from mobile clients on intermittent networks). However, BOSH is not tied solely to XMPP and can be used for other kinds of traffic.</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p>BOSH is defined in two specifications:</p>
