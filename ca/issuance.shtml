<title>XMPP ICA: Certificate Issuance HOWTO</title>
<!--#include virtual="/includes/head.txt" -->
<h2>XMPP ICA: Certificate Issuance HOWTO</h2>
<p>The <a href='/ca/'>XMPP Intermediate Certification Authority (ICA)</a> issues free domain certificates to administrators of XMPP-based services, where the root CA is <a href='http://www.startssl.com/'>StartCom</a>. The certificate issuance process is currently as follows (note: this process is subject to change).</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding, please make sure that:</p>
    <ol style='list-style: lower-alpha'>
      <li>
        <p>You have access to the one of the following email addresses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Hostmaster, postmaster, or webmaster @ your domain (see <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2142'>RFC 2142</a> and <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3912'>RFC 3192</a>).</p></li>
          <li><p>The registrant, administrative, or technical email address listed in <a href='whois.shtml'>Whois</a> for your domain.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Your domain registrar offers a native <a href='whois.shtml'>Whois</a> service (not just a web-based interface to Whois).</p></li>
      <li><p>Your domain is registered with a recognized domain registrar, not a <a href='dynamic-dns.shtml'>Dynamic DNS</a> service.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><p>Visit the <a href='launch.shtml'>Certificate Launch Page</a>, provide the requested information (which is sent to StartCom on submission), and click the Submit button.</p></li>
  <li><p>A new browser window or tab will open, sending you to <a href='https://xmpp.startcom.org/'>https://xmpp.startcom.org/</a> -- the web interface for users of the intermediate certification authority (ICA). (NOTE: you cannot access that website from anywhere else but the Certificate Launch Page, so don't try to type it into your browser!)</p></li>
  <li><p>The ICA website provides a 'wizard' that will walk you through the certificate request  process. <em><strong>Note:</strong> For detailed instructions, refer to the <a href='wizard.shtml'>Certificate Wizard Instructions</a>.</em></p></li>
  <li><p>Check your email and copy the verification code from the email message into the StartCom interface. NOTE: If you did not receive the email message, it is possible that you are blocking email from startcom.org, that the message is caught in your spam filters, that your mail server responds too slowly, that you don't have the proper email addresses set up, or that you have 'greylisting' set up for your domain (for greylisting, simply wait for the greylisting period to end, e.g. 300 seconds, then try again).</p></li>
  <li><p>After you enter the verification code, you will receive the certificate.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now follow the instructions in the <a href='installation.shtml'>Certificate README</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions throughout this process, feel free to contact <a href='https://stpeter.im/?page_id=1968'>Peter Saint-Andre</a> via email or IM.</p>
