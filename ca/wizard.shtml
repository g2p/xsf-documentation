<h2>XMPP ICA: Certificate Wizard Instructions</h2>
<p>This page contains detailed instructions for using the StartCom certificate creation wizard when obtaining a certificate from the <a href='/ca/'>XMPP ICA</a> in accordance with the <a href='issuance.shtml'>Certificate Issuance HOWTO</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>On the first page, you will be asked to choose between "Server Certificate (With CSR generation)" and "Server Certificate (Without CSR generation)". If you want StartCom to create the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for you (this is easier but gives you less control), then choose "with CSR generation". If you want to create your own Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using OpenSSL or your XMPP server software, choose "without CSR generation".</p></li>
  <li><p>On the second page, provide your personal information (not information about your organization). Please provide a complete first name and last name (not just initials), a working email address, your postal address (including street, postal or ZIP code, city, and country), and a working phone number (this can be a business number) with country code and, if necessary, internal extension.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you chose "with CSR generation" you will be asked to provide a password for your private key. Make sure you remember the password! Copy the key to a file on the machine that hosts your XMPP server and possibly back it up in a secure location.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you chose "without CSR generation" you will be asked to provide the Certificate Signing Request that you created. Please make sure that you provide complete and accurate information in your CSR, as explained in the next paragraphs.</p></li>
  <li><p>Whether you chose "with" or "without" CSR generation, you need to provide complete and accurate information about the domain for which you are requesting a certificate. If you chose "with CSR generation" you will now type this information into the StartCom interface. Please select the appropriate country, the state or province, the city ("place"), and the name of the organization. The name of the organization can be a company name, school name, individual name if this is a personal server, etc. Please see the next paragraph for the proper formatting of the DNS domain name.</p></li>
  <li><p>For the domain, provide the DNS hostname of the XMPP server. For example, if your organization is called "example.com" but your XMPP server is hosted at "im.example.com", type "im" in the first box at the StartCom interface, type "example" in the second box, and select "com" from the dropdown list at the end of the "Domain: xmpp:" line. You can also request a wildcard certificate such as *.example.com (type "*" in the first box, type "example" in the second box, and select "com" from the dropdown list). A wildcard domain enables you to use the same certificate for multiple components (e.g., "groupchat.example.com" as well as "im.example.com"). You can even use a wildcard certificate for a domain such as "www.example.com". NOTE: if your top-level domain is not available in the dropdown list, please send email to &lt;<a href='mailto:certmaster@xmpp.org'>mailto:certmaster@xmpp.org</a>&gt;.</p></li>
  <li><p>On the next page you will need to select an authorized email address (if you chose "with CSR generation" you will also see your CSR -- copy this to a file on the machine that hosts your XMPP server and possibly back it up to a secure location as well). This is the address to which a special verification code will be sent. Typically this will be one of hostmaster, postmaster, or webmaster, but you may be allowed to choose one or more email addresses listed in the whois record for your domain.</p></li>
