<h2>XSF Member Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Membership in the XMPP Standards Foundation is a privilege that is granted by existing members to active participants in the Jabber/XMPP community. Prospective members are expected to have made valuable contributions through writing code, deploying Jabber/XMPP services, creating documentation, authoring <a href='/extensions/'>XMPP Extension Protocols</a>, and so on. The best way to increase one's chances of election are to actively and visibly contribute to the Jabber/XMPP community.</p>
<p>Once elected, XSF members are expected to continue contributing to the Jabber/XMPP community and the work of the XMPP Standards Foundation through participation on the committees and interest groups of the XSF. In particular, members must participate in the ongoing governance of the XSF by voting in the quarterly and annual meetings of the membership. In accordance with Section 2.6 of the <a href="/xsf/docs/bylaws.shtml">XSF Bylaws</a>, any member who is inactive through three consecutive meetings is purged from the membership.</p>
