<p>The XSF has identified several high-priority initiatives for 2007 to help achieve that goal:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Finish definition of <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html'>Jingle</a> as an open technology for federated voice, video, and generalized multimedia communication (where the signalling or negotiation occurs over the XMPP channel and the media transfer occurs via established methods such as Real-time Transport Protocol), and encourage implementation in high-profile open-source client codebases (Q1 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Hold second and third XMPP interoperability testing events (Q1 and Q3 2007) and launch a secure online environment for ongoing XMPP testing over the Internet (Q1 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Complete revisions and corrections to <a href='/rfcs/rfc3920.html'>RFC 3920</a> and <a href='/rfcs/rfc3921.html'>RFC 3921</a> and advance <a href='/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-01.html'>rfc3920bis</a> and <a href='/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3921bis-01.html'>rfc3921bis</a> to a status of Draft Standard within the Internet Standards Process at the IETF (Q2 or Q3 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Complete definition of protocols (<a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0158.html'>XEP-0158</a>, <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0159.html'>XEP-0159</a>, <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0161.html'>XEP-0161</a>) and best practices (<a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0165.html'>XEP-0165</a>) for prevention of spam and denial of service attacks on the XMPP network (Q3 or Q4 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Finish definition of <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0116.html'>encrypted sessions</a> as the go-forward technology for end-to-end encryption of XMPP communications, and encourage implementation in high-profile open-source client and library codebases (Q3 or Q4 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Following up on the Q4 2006 establishment of an <a href='https://www.xmpp.net/'>intermediate certification authority</a> for the XMPP network, deploy ubiquitous channel encryption on the open network of XMPP servers (Q4 2007) and continue to work with other CAs on adding support for XMPP identities to their certificates (ongoing).</p></li>
  <li><p>Continue to develop a complete suite of XMPP extensions for real-time communication and collaboration (including extended presence, advanced messaging, data exchange, and shared editing), and encourage integration of those extensions into widely deployed open-source technologies and social networking applications (ongoing); the focus for 2007 will be on deployment of <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html'>personal eventing protocol</a> and development of protocol building blocks for sharing and joint editing of XML data for use in whiteboarding and similar collaboration technologies.</p></li>
</ol>
