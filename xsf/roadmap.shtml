<p>The overall goal of the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is to build an open, standardized, secure, feature-rich, widely-deployed, decentralized infrastructure for real-time communication in order to successfully supplant or co-opt proprietary, closed, centralized services such as AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, and Skype. The XSF has identified several high-priority initiatives for 2006-2007 to help achieve that goal:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Finish definition of <a href='http://www.jabber.org/xeps/xep-0166.html'>Jingle</a> as an open technology for federated voice, video, and generalized multimedia communication, and encourage implementation in high-profile open-source client codebases (Q1 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Hold second and third XMPP interoperability testing events (Q1 and Q3 2007) and launch a secure online environment for ongoing XMPP testing over the Internet (Q1 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Complete revisions to <a href='/rfcs/rfc3920.html'>RFC 3920</a> and <a href='/rfcs/rfc3921.html'>RFC 3921</a> and advance them to a status of Draft Standard at the IETF (Q2 or Q3 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Complete development of robust technologies for prevention of spam on the XMPP network (Q3 or Q4 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Finish definition of <a href='http://www.jabber.org/xeps/xep-0116.html'>encrypted sessions</a> as the go-forward technology for end-to-end encryption of XMPP communications, and encourage implementation in high-profile open-source client and library codebases (Q3 or Q4 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p>Deploy ubiquitous channel encryption on the open network of XMPP servers (Q4 2007).</p></li>
  <li><p><span style='text-decoration: line-through'>Establish the XSF as an intermediate CA for the XMPP server network through one or more root CAs (Q4 2006).</span> (complete)</p></li>
  <li><p><span style='text-decoration: line-through'>Clarify the branding of Jabber and XMPP, including migration of the XEP series to www.xmpp.org and re-launching of www.jabber.org (Q1 2007).</span> (complete)</p></li>
</ol>
