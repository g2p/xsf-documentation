Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Part of that fulfilling that mission is <a href='http://www.google.com/talk/'>Google Talk</a>, an instant messaging and voice chat service built on Jabber/XMPP technologies. Members of the Google Talk team are active contributors to the XMPP Standards Foundation's <a href='/extensions/'>standards process</a>, and Google is a Platinum Sponsor of the XSF through a generous financial contribution.</p>
