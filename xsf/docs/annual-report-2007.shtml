<a name="exec"></a><h3>1.0 Executive Summary</h3>
<p>XMPP technologies continue to mature and expand. The significant accomplishments in 2007 included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adoption of XMPP technologies accelerated not only in the traditional instant messaging realm but also in non-IM applications such as machine-to-machine communication.</li>
  <li>The XSF began the process of updating the XMPP RFCs (RFC 3920 and RFC 3921) to incorporate the results of widespread implementation and deployment experience gained since 2004.</li>
  <li>Work continued on a wide range of XMPP extensions within the XSF's standards process, including the Jingle extensions for multimedia session negotiation.</li>
  <li>To clarify the focus of the community on the XML wire protocol, the name of our standards development organization was changed from the Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) to the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).</li>
  <li>The XSF modified its Intellectual Property Rights policy to allow the inclusion of text, examples, and schemas from XMPP Extension Protocol specifications directly in free software programs.</li>
  <li>The XSF worked with a professional designer to produce a new logo for XMPP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details regarding these achievements and other aspects of progress for 2007 are described below.</p>

<a name="xeps"></a><h3>2.0 XMPP Extension Protocols</h3>
<p>The XSF's core competency is documentation of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (contributed in 2002 to the IETF; see the next section) and definition of new XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs). Because the XSF has been publishing Jabber/XMPP protocols since August 2001, we now have a fairly comprehensive protocol stack with a large installed base of implementations. As a result, we now spend more time maintaining existing specifications than we did several years ago. This is both good (incorporating feedback to make our protocols more secure and easier to implement) and bad (producing fewer XMPP extensions that define new features or address new problem domains). However, the XSF strives to continue working on and advancing appropriate XMPP extensions. To highlight the differences, the following summary of activity within the XSF's standards process divides the work into maintenance of existing standards, advancement of new extensions, and promising experimental work.</p>

<a name="xeps-maintenance"></a><h4>2.1 Maintenance of Existing Standards</h4>
<p>In 2007 the XSF completed major revisions to two important building block specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong><a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html'>XEP-0060: Publish-Subscribe</a>.</strong> This large specification was completely overhauled to clarify a number of points. In addition, the specification now also defines integration with instant messaging and presence services so that a normal IM account can function as a virtual publish-subscribe service, thus enabling "personal eventing" features for rich presence and invidualized content syndication (for details, see <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html'>XEP-0163: Personal Eventing via Pubsub</a>).</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html'>XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities</a>.</strong> The entity capabilities protocol is a real-time profile of <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html'>XEP-0030: Service Discovery</a>. Developer feedback revealed that this protocol made it possible for malicious or merely incompetent entities to poison entity capabilities information, and this poisoning attack was observed in the wild. Therefore the protocol was hardened and improved to prevent information poisoning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, smaller revisions and clarifications were made to protocols such as <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html'>XEP-0004: Data Forms</a>, <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0012.html'>XEP-0012: Last Activity</a>, <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html'>XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat</a>, <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html'>XEP-0071: XHTML-IM</a>, and <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0080.html'>XEP-0080: User Location</a>.</p>

<a name="xeps-advance"></a><h4>2.2 Advancement of New Extensions</h4>
<p>In 2007 the XSF completed documentation of <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html'>XEP-0174: Link-Local Messaging</a>. This specification defines the XMPP-based messaging technology used on local networks, as pioneered by Apple Computer's iChat client in Bonjour mode and subsequently emulated by a number of open-source clients.</p>
<p>The XSF also advanced to Draft status <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0155.html'>XEP-0155: Stanza Session Negotiation</a> (a protocol for formally negotiating the exchange of XMPP messages or stanzas between any two endpoints) and <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html'>XEP-0084: User Avatars</a> (a modern replacement for the older vCard-based avatar technology).</p>

<a name="xeps-experimental"></a><h4>2.3 Experimental Work</h4>
<p>Work has continued, albeit more slowly than desired, on finalizing two important XMPP technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong><a href='http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html'>XEP-0166: Jingle.</a></strong> The Jingle specifications formalize the multimedia session negotiation technology first defined by Google and deployed in its Google Talk service. Because there are relatively few implementations of the protocol as specified in the relevant XEPs, it has been difficult to obtain feedback on these specifications. However, the protocol is now implemented in the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, several Nokia devices, the Asterisk open-source PBX project, the FreeSWITCH open-source softswitch, and several other emerging projects. Final feedback is being gathered as of the time of this report and the specifications should be advanced to Draft status during Q1 2008.</p></li>

</ul>

<a name="ietf"></a><h3>3.0 IETF Activities</h3>
<p>Although the focus of the XMPP community's standardization efforts is the XEP series, the XSF continues to contribute to the Internet Standards Process run by the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href='http://www.ietf.org/'>IETF</a>). These contributions generally fall into four categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Revising the core XMPP RFCs to incorporate the results of implementation and deployment experience.</li>
  <li>Defining applications of XMPP by other IETF technologies, such as notifications generated by the Sieve email filtering or the Atom content syndication format.</li>
  <li>Reviewing and commenting on IETF technologies that are used by XMPP, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and International Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).</li>
  <li>Mapping between XMPP and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
</ol>
<p>The following sections provide more detailed information about these activities.</p>

<a name="community"></a><h3>4.0 Developer Community</h3>
<p>The XMPP developer community is large and diverse, containing occasional shareware programmers, active open-source projects, commercial software companies, and everything in between. Although the XMPP Standards Foundation does not directly contribute to any particular codebase that implements XMPP functionality, it recognizes the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem of implementations. Toward that end, the XSF hosts twice-yearly developer conferences and also participates in the yearly Google Summer of Code program for students. The XSF may in the future pursue additional opportunities to encourage widespread implementation of XMPP-friendly software, such as core XMPP support in popular programming languages.</p>
<a name="devcon"></a><h3>4.1 DevCon</h3>
<p>In July 2006, the XSF held the first XMPP DevCon coincident with the O'Reilly Open Source Software Convention (OSCON) in Portland, Oregon. The second DevCon was held in February 2007 coincident with the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting (FOSDEM) and the third DevCon was held in August 2007 coincident with OSCON 2007. These meetings, which each time brought together 10-15 different core developers from Europe and North America, have resulted in interoperability testing, brainstorming of solutions to advanced problems, development of new features, and a stronger developer community. The XSF will continue to hold DevCons twice a year at FOSDEM (Europe) and OSCON (North America) for the foreseeable future.</p>
<a name="devcon"></a><h3>4.2 Google Summer of Code</h3>
<p>The XSF has participated in the Google Summer of Code since its inception in 2004. The 2007 Summer of Code was especially productive because the XSF reduced the number of projects it sponsored and devoted more attention to the projects. A full report is available at &lt;<a href='http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=30'>http://blog.xmpp.org/?p=30</a>&gt;.</p>

<a name="interop"></a><h3>5.0 Interoperability and Compliance</h3>
<p>To follow.</p>

<a name="ica"></a><h3>6.0 Intermediate Certification Authority</h3>
<p>In December 2006, the XSF formed an intermediate certification authority (ICA) as one aspect of efforts to improve the security profile of XMPP technologies. Under an agreement with the StartCom certification authority, the ICA issues free digital certificates to administrators of XMPP servers. Through the end of 2007, the ICA had issued over 500 certificates via its website at &lt;<a href='https://www.xmpp.net/'>https://www.xmpp.net/</a>&gt;. In December 2007, the XSF renewed its agreement with StartCom, indicating a continued to commitment to information security.</p>

<a name="infrastructure"></a><h3>7.0 Infrastructure</h3>

<a name="ipr"></a><h3>8.0 IPR Policy</h3>
<p>In 2002, the XSF worked with law professors Lawrence Lessig and Molly van Houweling to develop an intellectual property rights (IPR) policy that would appropriately reflect the XSF's role in the broader Jabber/XMPP community. In late 2007, members of the free software community notified the XSF that the existing licensing of XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP) specifications prevented text, examples, schemas, code, and pseudo-code in XEPs from being included in free software programs, in particular the Debian distribution of the Linux operating system. The XSF quickly worked to research potential modifications to its IPR policy. After discussion among the XSF Board of Directors, the membership of the XSF, and the Debian community, the XSF settled upon a modified MIT license as appropriate for application to the XEP series. This change was approved by the XSF Board of Directors in early 2008.</p>

<a name="roadmap"></a><h3>9.0 Roadmap for 2008</h3>
<p>The XSF continually updates a roadmap at &lt;<a href='http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml'>http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml</a>&gt;, usually on a quarterly basis. The high-priority goals for include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete work on the Jingle extensions for multimedia negotiation.</li>
  <li>Complete revisions to the core XMPP RFCs.</li>
  <li>Launch an XMPP Operators Group to improve communication among organizations and service providers who deploy XMPP services.</li>
  <li>Lay the groundwork for ubiquitous encryption of server-to-server XMPP traffic by January 4, 2009.</li>
