<h2>Annual Report of the XMPP Standards Foundation: 2007</h2>
<p>This is the 2007 Annual Report of the <a href='http://www.xmpp.org/'>XMPP Standards Foundation</a> (XSF), a non-profit membership organization dedicated to documentation and development of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). More broadly, the mission of the XSF to build an open, standardized, secure, feature-rich, widely-deployed, decentralized infrastructure for real-time communication and collaboration over the Internet. This report, produced by the XSF Board of Directors, describes the progress achieved by the XSF and the broader Jabber/XMPP community in 2007.</p>

<a name="exec"></a><h3>1.0 Executive Summary</h3>
<p>XMPP technologies continue to mature and expand. The significant accomplishments in 2007 included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adoption of XMPP technologies accelerated not only in the traditional instant messaging realm but also in non-IM applications such as machine-to-machine communication.</li>
  <li>Work commenced on updating the XMPP RFCs (RFC 3920 and RFC 3921) to incorporate the results of widespread implementation and deployment experience gained since 2004.</li>
  <li>Work continued on a wide range of XMPP extensions within the XSF's standards process, including the Jingle extensions for multimedia session negotiation.</li>
  <li>To clarify the focus of the community on the XML wire protocol, the name of our standards development organization changed from the Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) to the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).</li>
  <li>The XSF modified its Intellectual Property Rights policy to allow the inclusion of text, examples, and schemas from XMPP Extension Protocol specifications directly in free software programs.</li>
  <li>The XSF worked with a professional designer to produce a new logo for XMPP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details regarding these achievements and other aspects of progress for 2007 are described below.</p>

<a name="adoption"></a><h3>2.0 XMPP Adoption</h3>

<a name="xeps"></a><h3>3.0 XSF Standards</h3>

<a name="ietf"></a><h3>4.0 IETF Activities</h3>
<p>Although the focus of the XMPP community's standardization efforts is the XEP series, the XSF continues to contribute to the Internet Standards Process run by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These contributions generally fall into four categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Revising the core XMPP RFCs to incorporate the results of implementation and deployment experience.</li>
  <li>Defining applications of XMPP by other IETF technologies, such as notifications generated by the Sieve email filtering or the Atom content syndication format.</li>
  <li>Reviewing and commenting on IETF technologies that are used by XMPP, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and International Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).</li>
  <li>Mapping between XMPP and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
</ol>

<a name="ica"></a><h3>5.0 Intermediate Certification Authority</h3>
<p>In December 2006, the XSF formed an intermediate certification authority (ICA) as one aspect of efforts to improve the security profile of XMPP technologies. Under an agreement with the StartCom certification authority, the ICA issues free digital certificates to administrators of XMPP servers. Through the end of 2007, the ICA had issued over 500 certificates via its website at &lt;<a href='https://www.xmpp.net/'>https://www.xmpp.net/</a>&gt;. In December 2007, the XSF renewed its agreement with StartCom, indicating a continued to commitment to information security.</p>

<a name="ipr"></a><h3>6.0 IPR Policy</h3>
<p>In 2002, the XSF worked with law professors Lawrence Lessig and Molly van Houweling to develop an intellectual property rights (IPR) policy that would appropriately reflect the XSF's role in the broader Jabber/XMPP community. In late 2007, members of the free software community notified the XSF that the existing licensing of XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP) specifications prevented text, examples, schemas, code, and pseudo-code in XEPs from being included in free software programs, in particular the Debian distribution of the Linux operating system. The XSF quickly worked to research potential modifications to its IPR policy. After discussion among the XSF Board of Directors, the membership of the XSF, and the Debian community, the XSF settled upon a modified MIT license as appropriate for application to the XEP series. This change was approved by the XSF Board of Directors in early 2008.</p>

<a name="roadmap"></a><h3>7.0 Roadmap for 2008</h3>
<p>The XSF continually updates a roadmap at &lt;<a href='http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml'>http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/roadmap.shtml</a>&gt;, usually on a quarterly basis. The high-priority goals for include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete work on the Jingle extensions for multimedia negotiation.</li>
  <li>Complete revisions to the core XMPP RFCs.</li>
  <li>Launch an XMPP Operators Group to improve communication among organizations and service providers who deploy XMPP services.</li>
  <li>Lay the groundwork for ubiquitous encryption of server-to-server XMPP traffic by January 4, 2009.</li>
</ul>
